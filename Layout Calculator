while True:
   print("Options:")
   print("Enter 'add' to add two numbers")
   print("Enter 'subtract' to subtract two numbers")
   print("Enter 'multiply' to multiply two numbers")
   print("Enter 'divide' to divide two numbers")
   print("Enter 'quit' to end the program")
   user_input = input(": ")

   if user_input == "quit":
      break
   elif user_input == "add":
      ...
   elif user_input == "subtract":
      ...
   elif user_input == "multiply":
      ...
   elif user_input == "divide":
      ...
   else:
      print("Unknown input")
      
      The next part of the program is getting the numbers the user wants to do something with. 
The code below shows this for the addition section of the calculator. Similar code would have to be written for the other sections.
elif user_input == "add":
  num1 = float(input("Enter a number: "))
  num2 = float(input("Enter another number: "))

Now, when the user inputs "add", the program prompts to enter two numbers, and stores them in the corresponding variables.
As it is, this code crashes if the user enters a non-numeric input when prompted to enter a number. We will look at fixing problems like this in a later module.


The final part of the program processes user input and displays it. 
The code for the addition part is shown here.
elif user_input == "add":
  num1 = float(input("Enter a number: "))
  num2 = float(input("Enter another number: "))
  result = str(num1 + num2)
  print("The answer is " + result)

We now have a working program that prompts for user input, and then calculates and prints the sum of the input.
Similar code would have to be written for the other branches (for subtraction, multiplication and division).
The output line could be put outside the if statements to omit repetition of code.
